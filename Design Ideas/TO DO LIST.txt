TO DO LIST:

1. Sign in page
    - Hash password
    - if statements
        - Search db for user; return if it was found. If not, error handling
    - if statements
        - search db for password; ...
    - Once signed, brings to database page

2. Registration
    - Link it to sign in page
    - fix the signed in date that's in the DbService file
    - the event listener has problems running with the other queries
        - have to figure out how to connect the event without interupting the other pages

3. Search Directory
    - first (works)
    - last (I have no idea why lastname won't work-- even if I manually write the address into my address bar)
    - first+last (First+Last won't work bc of lastname. When in address bar, it'll listen to first name only.)
    - username (works)
    - salary (min and max) (didn't get to it)
    - ages (min and max) (didn't get to it)
    - register dates (didn't get to it)
    - never signed in (didn't get to it)
    - registrations from today (didn't get to it)

    Updates: 
    1.  Idk if I'm just overly frustrated with the 2 box concept, but now I'm wondering if it'll be annoying to keep coding them for each double input 
        and maybe we should just use a split method and have the user enter their values with a comma separating it.
    2.  For some reason the queries that I labeled "works" will randomly work for me and then not work (even manually typing it into the address).
    3.  I had to comment out registration's function bc I think the event listener keeps trying to take over (I can work on solving this tomorrow)
    4.  Feel free to reconstruct the whole search directory (front and backend) if you need to. At this point, bare minimum would work for me and we can improve it on the next project.


4. search page html
    - search inputs
        - add it where 2 search inputs come up for some (done)
        - add checkbox for the registerDate (We could also just make two options if that's easier)
