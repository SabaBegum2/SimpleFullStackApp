TO DO LIST:

1. Sign in page
    - Updated date for signedin var

2. Registration
    - Link it to sign in page
    - fix the signed in date that's in the DbService file
    - the event listener has problems running with the other queries
        - have to figure out how to connect the event without interupting the other pages

3. Search Directory
    - first (works)
    - last (I have no idea why lastname won't work-- even if I manually write the address into my address bar)
    - first+last (First+Last won't work bc of lastname. When in address bar, it'll listen to first name only.)
    - username (works)
    - salary (min and max) (didn't get to it)
    - ages (min and max) (didn't get to it)
    - register dates (didn't get to it)
    - never signed in (didn't get to it)
    - registrations from today (didn't get to it)

4. search page html
    - search inputs
        - add it where 2 search inputs come up for some (done)
        - add checkbox for the registerDate (We could also just make two options if that's easier)
