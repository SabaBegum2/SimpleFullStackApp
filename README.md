# SimpleFullStackApp

In this project, we will create a user table and then use it to register a new user and then allows the user to sign into a website.

We will implement the following interface and functionality:
1. User registration.
2. User sign-in.
3. search users by first and/or last name.
4. search users by userid;
5. search all users whose salary is between X and Y.
6. Search all users whose ages are between X and Y.
7. Search users who registered after john registered, where john is the userid.
8. search users who never signed in.
9. Search users who registered on the same day that john registered.
10. Return the users who registered today.
